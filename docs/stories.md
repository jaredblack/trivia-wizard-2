We are building the Trivia Wizard app as described in overview.md. We will only implement in small, well-defined stories, which are defined in this document.

## near future
- Need strongly typed frontend model classes. Lots of gotchas especially for the LLM around the serde rename traits

## misc
- update verification email
- set an alarm on log::error from my app?


## edge cases worth considering
- someone tries to create a game with the same code as another currently-connected host
